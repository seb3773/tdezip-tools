/* Near-duplicate detection via SimHash.
 *
 * SimHash produces a fixed-size fingerprint where similar documents
 * have fingerprints with small Hamming distance.  Two files are
 * "near-duplicates" if their SimHash fingerprints differ in fewer
 * than a threshold number of bits.
 *
 * This detects patched executables, slightly edited documents, and
 * minor revisions — cases where CDC chunks might not align but the
 * overall content is structurally similar.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   uint64_t h1 = uc2_simhash(data1, len1);
 *   uint64_t h2 = uc2_simhash(data2, len2);
 *   int dist = uc2_hamming(h1, h2);
 *   if (dist <= 10) // near-duplicates
