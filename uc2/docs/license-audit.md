# UC2 License Audit

Status: 2026-05-03. Maintained by Eremey Valetov.

UC2 v3 builds on three layers of prior work, each released under its
own free-software licence.  This document records per-file provenance,
the LGPL-3.0 -> GPL-3.0 transition rationale, and the SPDX identifiers
applied across the source tree.

## Layer 1: Nico de Vries (1992-1996), released 2015

Nico de Vries authored UltraCompressor II as proprietary DOS software
between 1992 and 1996, with co-development from Danny Bezemer,
Jan-Pieter Cornet, and others credited in the original `U_MANUAL.TXT`.
In December 2015, Vladislav Sagunov asked de Vries whether the source
could be re-released under a free licence; de Vries agreed and
personally published the full source under the GNU Lesser General
Public License v3 (LGPL-3.0), with a small Borland C/C++ runtime
carve-out for DOS-specific code.

The 2015 release is preserved in this repository under
`original/UC2_source/` byte-for-byte unchanged, including its license
header (`GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3.txt`) and the original
binaries (`uc2pro.exe`, `uc237b.exe`, `ue.exe`).  No file in `lib/` or
`cli/` is a verbatim copy of any file in that release.  The 2015 source
serves as the format specification: it is read for documentation
purposes (the on-disk archive layout, the SuperMaster dictionary
contents, the Huffman tree encoding) but its C code is not linked in.

Relicensing impact: none.  Layer 1 is preserved under its original
LGPL-3.0 licence; nothing is moved upward to GPL-3.0.

## Layer 2: Jan Bobrowski (2020-2021), libunuc2 / unuc2

Jan Bobrowski wrote a clean-room portable decompressor for UC2 v3
archives between 2020 and 2021.  He released two products:

- `libunuc2` (decompression library) under LGPL-3.0
- `unuc2` (CLI tool) under GPL-3.0-or-later

The upstream source is preserved in `original/unuc2-0.6/`.  The
following files in this repository derive from Bobrowski's work and
retain his original licence:

| Current file                          | Upstream origin                          | Licence       |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `lib/src/decompress.c`                | `original/unuc2-0.6/libunuc2.c`          | LGPL-3.0-only |
| `lib/src/list.h`                      | `original/unuc2-0.6/list.h` (identical)  | LGPL-3.0-only |
| `lib/src/super.bin`                   | `original/unuc2-0.6/super.bin` (identical) | data (de Vries) |
| `lib/include/uc2/libuc2.h`            | `original/unuc2-0.6/libunuc2.h`          | LGPL-3.0-only |
| `cli/src/main.c`                      | `original/unuc2-0.6/unuc2.c`             | GPL-3.0-or-later |
| `cli/src/compat/compat_win32.c`       | `original/unuc2-0.6/compat/compat.c` (Win32 portions) | LGPL-3.0-only |
| `cli/src/compat/compat_dos.c`         | derived from `compat/compat.c` (DOS adaptation by Valetov) | LGPL-3.0-only |

Modifications by Valetov in 2026 are released under the same licence
as the file's upstream origin (LGPL-3.0 stays LGPL-3.0; GPL-3.0 stays
GPL-3.0).  No unilateral upgrade from LGPL to GPL has been applied to
Bobrowski's work.

`lib/src/super.bin` is the SuperMaster dictionary block from the 1992
distribution.  It is data, not code: a fixed binary table used as a
compression-context priming dictionary.  It is bit-identical to the
file in Bobrowski's release and to the data extracted from de Vries's
1992 binaries.

## Layer 3: Eremey Valetov (2026), UC2 v3 revival

The following files are new work by Valetov, originally authored for
the UC2 v3 revival project, released under GPL-3.0-or-later:

| File                                  | Function                                           |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `lib/src/compress.c`                  | LZ77+Huffman compressor (inverse of decompress.c)  |
| `lib/src/uc2_tables.c`                | Huffman delta-coding lookup tables                 |
| `lib/src/uc2_internal.h`              | Shared compressor/decompressor types and constants |
| `lib/src/uc2_cdc.c` + `.h`            | Content-defined chunking (Gear hash)               |
| `lib/src/uc2_merkle.c` + `.h`         | Merkle DAG of deduplicated blocks                  |
| `lib/src/uc2_blockstore.c` + `.h`     | Cross-archive content-addressable block store     |
| `lib/src/uc2_simhash.c` + `.h`        | SimHash near-duplicate detection                   |
| `lib/src/uc2_delta.c` + `.h`          | Binary delta compression                           |
| `lib/src/uc2_rans.c` + `.h`           | rANS entropy coder (method 10)                     |
| `lib/src/uc2_dict.c` + `.h`           | Dictionary metadata for cross-archive sharing      |
| `lib/src/uc2_preprocess.c` + `.h`     | BCJ / BWT / delta-filter preprocessing             |
| `lib/src/uc2_lz4.c` + `.h`            | LZ4 ultra-fast compression                         |
| `lib/src/uc2_blake3.c` + `.h`         | BLAKE3 cryptographic hashing                       |
| `lib/src/uc2_sha256.c` + `.h`         | SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4)                               |
| `lib/src/uc2_ots.c` + `.h`            | OpenTimestamps proof parser, walker, trailer      |
| `cli/src/compat/getopt.c`             | Minimal POSIX getopt for MSVC                      |
| `cli/src/main.c` (post-`9525a81` additions) | OTS attach/extract/info, archive creation, scanning, benchmark | GPL-3.0-or-later (matches upstream `unuc2.c`) |

The Phase 3-7 modules are independent implementations.  They reference
the UC2 v3 archive format (which is a bitstream layout, not a
copyrighted work) and use BLAKE3, SHA-256, LZ4, rANS, etc. from
public-domain or self-authored reference implementations.  None of
these modules link to or derive from Bobrowski's code beyond using
shared header types declared in `uc2_internal.h`.

## Relicensing rationale

The composite project links Bobrowski's LGPL-3.0 library (`lib/`) into
a GPL-3.0-or-later executable (`cli/`).  This combination is permitted
by LGPL-3.0 sec. 4 (Combined Works): the LGPL library may be used in
GPL-licensed work without requiring the library itself to be relicensed.

No code has been moved from LGPL-3.0 to GPL-3.0 in this project.
LGPL §3 permits a one-way upgrade from LGPL to GPL but exercising it
is unnecessary here: the LGPL files remain LGPL, the GPL files remain
GPL, and the combined work is distributable under GPL-3.0-or-later (as
recorded in the project root `LICENSE` file).

If a downstream user wishes to redistribute `lib/` standalone under
LGPL-3.0, the LGPL-3.0 files are individually identifiable via their
SPDX-License-Identifier headers.

## SPDX policy

All source files in `lib/` and `cli/` carry one of two SPDX
identifiers near the top:

- `SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-3.0-only` for files derived from
  Bobrowski's libunuc2 / compat code.
- `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` for `cli/src/main.c`
  (matches Bobrowski's original GPL-3.0-or-later choice for the CLI
  tool) and for all Valetov-authored Phase 2 through Phase 7 work.

Original copyright lines authored by Bobrowski are preserved verbatim
where present.  Where Valetov has added substantial new content to a
Bobrowski-originated file (notably `cli/src/main.c` and
`compat_dos.c`), an additional Valetov copyright line has been added
without removing the original.

The 2015 LGPL-3.0 release in `original/UC2_source/` and the 2020-2021
release in `original/unuc2-0.6/` are preserved unchanged and are not
subject to this policy: they retain whatever licence headers their
authors shipped them with.

## Audit checklist

- [x] LGPL-3.0 release by Bezemer/de Vries preserved unchanged in
      `original/UC2_source/`
- [x] LGPL-3.0 / GPL-3.0 release by Bobrowski preserved unchanged in
      `original/unuc2-0.6/`
- [x] Per-file provenance table above
- [x] SPDX-License-Identifier on every source file in `lib/` and `cli/`
- [x] CREDITS.md attributes Bobrowski specifically for libunuc2-derived
      files, not as generic "inspiration"
- [x] LICENSE-HISTORY summary published as this file
      (`docs/license-audit.md`)
- [x] No silent LGPL-to-GPL upgrade: every Bobrowski-origin file
      retains LGPL-3.0-only
