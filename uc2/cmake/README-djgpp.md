# DJGPP cross-compile

This builds `uc2.exe` for DOS / FreeDOS using the DJGPP toolchain.
The output is a 32-bit protected-mode DOS executable that runs under
the bundled `cwsdpmi.exe` extender (or any DPMI host).

## One-time setup

1. Get a DJGPP cross-toolchain.  The simplest source is the prebuilt
   release from `andrewwutw/build-djgpp`:

   ```sh
   curl -fsLO https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/download/v3.4/djgpp-linux64-gcc1220.tar.bz2
   sudo mkdir -p /opt && sudo tar xjf djgpp-linux64-gcc1220.tar.bz2 -C /opt
   ```

   This puts the toolchain at `/opt/djgpp/`.  Use any prefix; pass
   it as `-DDJGPP_ROOT=<prefix>` when configuring.

2. (Linux hosts) Make sure your shell has not exported `CPATH` or
   `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`.  Some distros and dev environments
   (Intel oneAPI, certain conda envs) export them.  GCC honours these
   regardless of `-nostdinc`, so any host include directory listed there
   ends up *first* in the cross-compiler's search path -- typically
   pulling in glibc headers that fail to compile against DJGPP libc.
   Either `unset CPATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` for the build shell, or
   wrap the cmake invocation in `env -u CPATH -u CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`.

## Build

```sh
unset CPATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
cmake -B build-djgpp \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/djgpp.cmake \
      -DDJGPP_ROOT=/opt/djgpp
cmake --build build-djgpp
```

Output: `build-djgpp/cli/uc2` (also linked as `uc2.exe`).  Copy it
plus `cwsdpmi.exe` (shipped with DJGPP at
`<DJGPP_ROOT>/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp/bin/cwsdpmi.exe`) to a DOS volume.

## Status

- Compiles clean against the DJGPP gcc 12.2.0 toolchain (the
  `cmake/djgpp.cmake` include paths are pinned to that version; the
  CI job and the andrewwutw v3.4 release both use 12.2.0).
- Library (`libuc2.a`) builds without changes.
- CLI uses the DOS compat layer in `cli/src/compat/compat_dos.c` for
  the BSD `err.h` and POSIX `fnmatch` shims.
- Runtime smoke test verified: `uc2 -h` and `uc2 -l <archive>` both
  succeed under DOSBox-X via `tests/scripts/dos_smoke.sh`.

## Smoke test

```sh
# 1. Get CWSDPMI extender:
curl -fsLO http://www.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2misc/csdpmi7b.zip
unzip csdpmi7b.zip -d /tmp/cwsdpmi

# 2. Run the smoke test (needs flatpak install com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X):
tests/scripts/dos_smoke.sh \
    build-djgpp/cli/uc2.exe \
    /tmp/cwsdpmi/bin/CWSDPMI.EXE \
    tests/archives/basic.uc2
```

Exits 0 on success.  Skips (with a "SKIP: ..." line) if any of:
the DJGPP build was not run, CWSDPMI.EXE is missing, or DOSBox-X is
not installed.

## Notes

- The toolchain sets `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic` and `-nostdinc` with
  explicit DJGPP include paths, so the compiler check links a test
  binary (rather than running one) and host headers never leak in.
- DJGPP's `unistd.h` provides POSIX-shaped APIs; most of the existing
  source compiles unchanged.  The library has no DOS-specific code
  paths.
